I am a Data Science masters student at the Data Science Institute, University of Virginia. With an eclectic background through my education and engagements with organizations in different domains, I am passionate about finding interdisciplinary applications of data science, particularly in the field of life sciences, sports, literature, politics and engineering through my experience and expertise in Natural Language, Computer Vision and Computational Social Science.

I am currently working with [Dr. Donald E. Brown](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/donald-e-brown-phd){:target="\_blank"}, [Dr. Sana Syed](https://research.med.virginia.edu/chrc/current-projects/sana-syed-md-ms/){:target="\_blank"} and a team of researchers at the UVA Child Health Research Center to develop a deep learning framework using computer vision to predict and classify celiac and environmental enteropathy disease based on digitized duodenal biopsy slides and patients’ biomarker data. The research is being carried out in collaboration with and is funded by the [Bill and Melinda Gates foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

I completed my undergraduate education from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} in 2017 where I presented my bachelor thesis titled “Data Driven Modeling of Composites” under the guidance of [Dr. Siladitya Pal](https://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/ME/pages/People+Siladitya_Pal.html){:target="\_blank"}. I developed an algorithmic framework to predict properties of composites to aid in the meta-modeling process. The thesis is highly regarded in our academic department for being the first to successfully use advanced analytics in the field of mechanical and material science. During this time, I was a part of the [Information Management Group](https://img.channeli.in/){:target="\_blank"}, an exclusive campus coding society, as a member of which, I was involved with the development of various software and web-based applications. I also became the Editor-in-Chief of [Geek Gazette](https://geekgazette.org/){:target="\_blank"}, the campus technical magazine and a core member of the Quizzing Society. As a result, I developed an eclectic pool of knowledge and could figure out several creative ways of applying data science in the field of science, finance, arts, and sports.
